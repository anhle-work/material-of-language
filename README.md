# Material of Language

Notes and notebooks for [Material of Language](http://mol.decontextualize.com/).

If you want to play around with the notebooks or can't get the dependencies
working on your machines, [the repository is available on
Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aparrish/material-of-language/79996cd2c39bd58e79ee7b2f5d5c22bff13581c6).
Everything should work there, just make sure to download your modified
notebooks and output to your own computer when you're done.

**Please note that many of these notebooks do not display correctly in GitHub's
preview** for some reason. (In particular, the "Concrete compositions" and
"Letters as numbers" notebooks are significantly truncated.) Please download
these and view them locally!
